It's dry yet juicy and rich, has present and firm tannin, everything feels correct and it's beautifully poised. Sunday Lunch will be all the better alongside a bottle of this.",£24,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/sonoma-county-cabernet-sauvignon,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/80-2x.jpg
Rodney Strong,Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,,dry,full bodied,,"Many experts consider Alexander Valley to be just as exceptional for Cabernet Sauvignon as Napa, which makes a wine like this very exciting. Lots of power, but effortlessly under control and in focus, this is a confident bottling for sure. You quite often find these notes of grilled meat and dark chocolate from AV Cabernet, and like Napa, the fruit here is immaculate, ripe and concentrated but not one iota jammy or baked.",£30,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/alexander-valley-cabernet-sauvignon,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/82-2x.jpg
Pott,Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,,dry,full bodied,,"An exceptionally rare wine and those lucky enough to get some are in for a treat. A highly terroir focussed Cabernet, it could only be from Napa and really captures the essence of the whole valley. An incredibly generous, expressive and intense wine, it's effortlessly powerful, with space for rose and incense framed aromatics to shine. It's not enormous texturally - like great Bordeaux it doesn't need to be as the fruit is so sublime.",£95,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/napa-valley-cabernet-sauvignon,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/135-2x.jpg
Silver Oak,Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cabernet Sauvignon,,,,dry,full bodied,,"From a true Californian Icon, this wine is a hedonistic, immensely delicious example of why Alexander Valley is so good. Concentrated, juicy bramble fruit, with these wonderful complexities of charred meat and black olive, it's a prodigious wine, so clear and technically brilliant - world class elevage. You can put this in the cellar, but it's so good now, you really don't need to.",£95,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/alexander-valley-cabernet-sauvignon_2,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/65-2x.jpg
Lillian,Santa Barbera Syrah,red,Syrah,,,,dry,full bodied,,"Having trained under Manfred Krankl at Sine Qua Non, Maggie Harrison has some serious winemaking pedigree, and wow how it shines through in her wines. This syrah is ludicrously polished with immense saline, sea-spray minerality. There is so much to admire, from the glycerin texture, to this smoky, bacon fat over bonfire embers character, and the contrasting, floating, light as a feather high notes of lavender and pot-pourri. Intensely graceful, yet intensely powerful. Genius.",£95,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/santa-barbera-syrah,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/66-2x.jpg
Thackery & Co,Orion,red,Syrah,,,,dry,full bodied,,"The top wine from idiosyncratic winemaker Sean Thackery, Orion is a no holds barred, rambunctious syrah with bags and bags of personality. It's turned up to 11 in pretty much every way, but it's not out of kilter, over-extracted or clumsy at all, it's precisely balanced and very, very impressive, with lots of syrah typicity and aromatic personality. It could cellar for decades, but it's a fascinating wine to study now.",£150,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/orion,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/42-2x.jpg
Thackery & Co,Pleiades Red Blend,red,Red Blend,,,,dry,medium,,"Sean Thackery calls this wine as his 'chef's special' referring to the fact that each year he makes this with whatever grapes he can get his hands on and you just gotta trust him. It's a highly unique, arresting wine which takes you by surprise as there is just nothing else like it. It does feel Californian in that it's ripe, and the dried fruit character has a southern Italian rustic nature to it, but in reality it's not worth pigeonholing Pleiades - you just have to try it and see for yourself.",£36,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/pleiades-red-blend,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/13-2x.jpg

Designed to be ageworthy and the match of Napa Cabernet, it does have luxurious structure and weight, but also a lightness of touch, an elegance.

Three Sticks,Head High Sonoma Chardonnay,white,Chardonnay,Y,,,dry,medium,,"Head High Chardonnay is a bit of a well kept secret, as Three Sticks simply use some declassified fruit from their top wines (from a number of the greatest Sonoma vineyards), and make a wine to be approachable and ideal when young. And it is indeed so precocious, the chardonnay fruit, there without any oak seasoning, is phenomenal - mineral driven and clean. So much to admire here.",£25,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/head-high-sonoma-chardonnay,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/36-2x.jpg
Soter,North Valley Chardonnay,white,Chardonnay,,,,dry,medium,,"Soter are one of the great names in Oregon and their Chardonnays are built with purpose and drive. This wine feels somewhat European - the fruit teeters on the brink of ripeness, Chablis-style, and it's lean and lithe, driven by acid, with a restrained use of oak - it does have a toasty vanilla character, but it's far from dominant. Pure, citrusy and food friendly - it'd be ideal with lobster.",£32,,
Groth,Hillview Estate Chardonnay,white,Chardonnay,,,,dry,full bodied,,"From Oak Knoll, one of the coolest parts of Napa, Hillview Chardonnay is a classic Californian interpretation. It has richness and silky weight, the fruit is tropical and it's creamy like Italian meringue. What defines wines like this against Chardonnay from elsewhere is how ripe and indulgent they are - the concentrated fruit, the butterscotch, the viscous glide of the wine in the glass, yet when done well, like this exceptional wine from Groth, they have excellently balanced acidity too.",£45,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/hillview-estate-chardonnay,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/38-2x.jpg
Hudson,Chardonnay,white,Chardonnay,,,,dry,full bodied,,"Try not to love this wine and we think you'll struggle somewhat - it has Montrachet-esque poise and weight, with Californian flair and generosity. You could list flavour characteristics all day with this wine, it's absurdly complex, mouth-coatingly viscous and utterly seductive. Then you talk about the length - it's just never-ending, it goes on for minutes.

Groth,Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc,white,Sauvignon Blanc,,,,dry,light,,"Sometimes Napa Sauvignon feels like an afterthought, a way of making use of the land not right for the Cabernet. But not with this wine from Groth. You get the sense tasting this wine that a lot of thought, care and attention has gone into it, the array of fruit character ranging from zesty citrus right through to tropical is quite something, and the acidity in contrast has been judged to perfection, making this a palate-jolting treat.",£33,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/napa-valley-sauvignon-blanc,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/152-2x.jpg

","Alban Vineyards are pretty unique in the world of wine in that they are best known for their work with Viognier. Aside from winemakers in Condireu, you'd say Alban, and potentially Yalumba of Australia are the two greatest Viognier producers in the world. Viognier is very difficult to get right, but here you can see what's possible - momentous concentration of peachy fruit, creamy honey (but not at all due to oxidation) and surprising levels of freshness and acid.",£38,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/central-coast-viognier,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/146-2x.jpg
Twomey,Russian River Pinot Noir,red,Pinot Noir,,,,dry,medium,,"In few locations is Pinot Noir as at home as it is in Russian River Valley and this bottle from Twomey is a wine you really don't want to end - a gorgeous, opulent, dancing, fragrant Pinot Noir with so much to admire. It's intense but not extracted, light but not lightweight and the fruit is just so bright and charismatic.

Sokol Blosser,Evolution Red (multi blend),red,Red Blend,Y,,,dry,light,,"A fun wine from Sokol Blosser. The blend is generally kept a secret, and the wine is non-vintage, which has led to a lot of attention and tongue in cheek questioning as to how the wine is actually made. But aside from the esoteric method at play, this is a really top class wine, lush and fruit driven, natural, so it has that classic bruised red apple skin note, but it's clean and crunchy, interesting and terroir driven.",£18,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/evolution-red-multi-blend,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/161-2x.jpg
Lo-Fi Wines,Chardonnay 2019,white,Chardonnay,Y,,,dry,medium,,"Lo-Fi Chardonnay is a super confident wine - a wine made with great touch and finesse. It's light, for a Californian Chardonnay, with high acidity, a fresh, vibrant flavour profile - think cooking apple skins, and there's a discreet use of oak, very much sitting in the background, but subtly softening and seasoning. A very easy going, friendly Chardonnay, but one that you'll want again and again.",£28,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/chardonnay-2019,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/157-2x.jpg
Ovum Wines,Old Love Riesling,white,Riesling,Y,,,dry,light,,"A total head-turner, Old Love Riesling is a breathtaking, dramatic riesling. Soaring acidity could feel dominant, but it doesn't at all - waxy, orange and lemon driven fruit is so rich, aromatic and textural, the summer florals so eye-catching. The wine finishes with a moreish, saline, mineral freshness. Drink with a plate of fresh anchovies or blowtorched sardines.",£22,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/old-love-riesling,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/164-2x.jpg
Lo-Fi Wines,Chenin Blanc,white,Chenin Blanc,Y,,,dry,medium,,"From Jurassic Park Vineyard, this is a stylish, but very approachable Chenin Blanc - it's highly terroir driven and fruit-forward, the flavour profile contains lots of things, perhaps coincidentally, that are grown in California - apples, peaches, lemons, almonds. It was aged in neutral, old oak for 6 months, which lends a creamy, soft feel to the wine. Drink outside with an al fresco lunch and it'll make you happy.",£27,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/chenin-blanc,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/156-2x.jpg
Louis M. Martini,Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon,red,Cabernet Sauvignon,N,,,dry,medium full,,"From one of the original Napa Cabernet pioneers, it's easy to see why this wine is so phenomenally popular in California - it is utterly quintessential; a textbook example. It enters plump and round, the fruit sweet and juicy, but ripe, not jammy. Then you get all the hallmarks of serious cabernet appearing in line - savoury cedar, sweet vanilla from oak and fine, supple tannins. It finishes dry and savoury.",£20,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/sonoma-county-cabernet-sauvignon-2018,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/63-2x.jpg

Varner Wines,Foxglove Pinot Noir,red,Pinot Noir,N,,,dry,light,,"Foxglove is the second label from Varner, but it's a label into which a lot of care and attention goes, from sourcing the best Central Coast fruit to using the same production methods as their top wines. It certainly shows in this dashing wine, a Pinot which has a simple, delicious fruit/oak flavour profile, but that oak is unobtrusive and authentic and the fruit is perfumed and vivid. Just very good.",£20,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/wine/foxglove-pinot-noir,https://www.pacificwines.co.uk/assets/images/products/18-2x.jpg
Cristom,Eola-Amity Hills Chardonnay,white,Chardonnay,,,,dry,medium,,"This wine from Cristom is really sensational, and pretty rare. They say Oregon is the mirror of Burgundy, and that certainly makes sense when you taste this wine - it has ravishing acidity and clarity alongside cool climate fruit - lemon zest and pear, and then towards the end you find the weight, the caramelised, creamy side to the wine which comes from French Oak, but it's integrated so brilliantly and it has remarkable length.
